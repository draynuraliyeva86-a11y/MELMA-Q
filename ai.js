ROLE: You are a Forensic Medical Auditor.
TASK: Audit the "LLM Answer" against the "Scenario" using the 30-POINT FORENSIC MATRIX.

*** SCORING PROTOCOL ***
For EVERY item (Q1-Q30), you must assign a score based strictly on these definitions. 
**DO NOT AVERAGE.** Look for the highest level fully met.
